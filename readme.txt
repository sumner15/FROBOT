FRobot is the set of custom BCI2000 software for the FINGER BCI project, a collaboration between NCAN/Wadsworth NY DOH and UC Irvine. 
This set of programs/parameters was developed using the helloFINGER project revision #24 (5/29/16), which provides access to the xpc libraries and thus the robot. It uses the controller from controller_files rev. #20. This controller set was designed with user-initiated movements in mind. 
 
To run this program:
Run FRobotTask.bat (C:\FRobot\). 
Load the appropriate parameter file. 
Load any necessary fragment files (C:\FRobot\parms\..)
